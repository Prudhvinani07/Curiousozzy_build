Evaluate each aspect of the solution with these key questions:
1. ﻿﻿﻿Does the analysis directly address the problem?
2. ﻿﻿﻿Were all possible causes considered, or are there unassessed factors?
3. ﻿﻿﻿Is this the simplest and most direct solution?
4. ﻿﻿﻿Is it feasible in terms of resources and costs?
5. ﻿﻿﻿Will the solution have the expected impact, and is it sustainable?
6. ﻿﻿﻿Are there ways to simplify or improve the solution?
7. ﻿﻿﻿What are the essential requirements versus those that are just a plus?
8. ﻿﻿﻿Show me the minimal reproducible example.
9. ﻿﻿﻿What edge cases should we consider?
10. ﻿﻿﻿﻿What testing approach would validate this solution?
If you identify ambiguities, suggest clarifying questions and, if possible, offer improvement alternatives.
